# CellSIM
Simulating the lives of cells.

This is an experimental/educational project that aims to simulate the lives of cells.
The idea is to build a world based on a grid, and the grid contains cells and food for the cells.
Food is represented as sugar, and it's what the cells "hunt" for during their lives.

A number of different hunt mechanisms will be developed to test the efficiency of each one.

Apart from this, cells will divide and mutate over time!
