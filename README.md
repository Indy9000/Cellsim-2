# CellSIM
Simulating the lives of cells.

ABOUT
This is an experimental/educational project that aims to simulate the lives of cells.
The idea is to build a world based on a grid, and the grid contains cells and food for the cells.
Food is represented as sugar, and it's what the cells "hunt" for during their lives.

In essence, this is a cell AI simulator.

HOW TO JOIN
Simply build your own class in the Cell package and extend my own Cell object. Then override whatever you like and test your cell against the world.

LANGUAGE
It's built JavaFX in NetBeans IDE, however for building cells only, native Java will do just fine.
